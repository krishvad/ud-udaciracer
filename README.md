# Welcome to the One and only UdaciRacer Simulation Game

## Project Introduction

Here is a udaciracer-mariokart game that uses Mariokart characters and tracks to create a racing simuation!

The game mechanics are this: you select a player and track, the game begins and you accelerate your racer by clicking an acceleration button. As you accelerate so do the other players and the leaderboard live-updates as players change position on the track. After the race is complete, a results page will be displayed with the players' rankings.

The game has three main views:

1. The form to create a race

2. The race progress view (this includes the live-updating leaderboard and acceleration button)

3. The race results view

## Getting Started

### Install dependencies
`npm install`

### Run the game engine API

The game engine API file is a binary that cannot be edited. To run the API follow the instructions below:


| Your OS               | Command to start the API                                  |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mac                   | `ORIGIN_ALLOWED=http://localhost:3000 ./bin/server-osx`   |
| Windows               | `ORIGIN_ALLOWED=http://localhost:3000 ./bin/server.exe`   |
| Linux (Ubuntu, etc..) | `ORIGIN_ALLOWED=http://localhost:3000 ./bin/server-linux` |

Note that this process will use your terminal tab, so you will have to open a new tab and navigate back to the project root to start the front end.

#### WINDOWS USERS -- Setting Environment Variables
If you are using a windows machine:
1. `cd` into the root of the project containing data.json
2. Run the following command to add the environment variable:
```set DATA_FILE=./data.json```

If you still run into issues running the API server on your machine, you can run this project in the Udacity classroom.


### Start the Frontend

Run `npm start` and then you should be able to access http://localhost:3000 in a web browser of your choice

### Errors

Look for any error logs in the browser console as they will be printed there
